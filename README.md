What is pagination?

Pagination is the process of separating print or digital content into discrete pages. For print documents and some online content, pagination also refers to the automated process of adding consecutive numbers to identify the sequential order of pages.

In print media, pagination is used to divide a document into pages, usually for numbering them. The term can also refer to the physical process of creating individual pages by hand or with machinery.

In digital media, pagination involves dividing content into discrete pages, usually for navigation. For example, a blog might use pagination to divide up its posts into separate pages, each with a limited number of entries. Web applications also use pagination to divide lists of results into manageable chunks.
